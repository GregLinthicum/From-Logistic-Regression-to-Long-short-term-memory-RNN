As the technology emerges from the state where the machine did not even get the words you were uttering and responded in a choppy robotic way to the open space of the creativity unimaginable ever before some basic code snippets never age.

  Time is money. It is well established in Machine Learning to refer to the error between computed and expected value as a Cost. 
  The error might convert to money in numerous applications that target classification or prediction. 
  On the other hand, the time by which the model renders its verdict is not negligible from a cost perspective.
  
   Please have a look at "NeuralNetworks", a Java implementation of Neural Network by Deus Jeraldy with a timestamp added 
    and see yourself that the same Cost ( as defined by the ML/NN) can be reached within substantially different computing times 
    that as you change the number oh hidden nodes, activation function used, or a number of predefined iterations.
